# Clean Deployment Portfolio (Prepared for Dhruv)

This cleaned repository contains the deployment-ready static website for presentation.

## How to deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a **new public** GitHub repository.
2. Upload all files from this repository root.
3. In GitHub repo -> Settings -> Pages -> Branch: `main` (or `master`) -> / (root) -> Save.
4. Wait a minute and visit: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

## Notes
- This repo has been cleaned to remove development artifacts.
- If your site uses a build step (e.g. Vite, React) ensure you upload the final `dist` or `build` folder instead.
